# Library Management System 

**Project Overview**

The objective of this project is to design and query the Library Management System database using SQL to analyse key metrics such as Book Availability, member activity, return status, popular books, and operational efficiency. This project includes creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations and utilizing CTAS to query results on useful business insights, and developing complex queries to analyze specific data

**Insights Gained**

* Identifying Total Rental Income for each category of books
* Determining the average borrowing duration and later return trends
* Analyzed category-wise Borrowing Preferences
* Summarized records to determine the total number of books and their issued count
* Finding Overdue books across different sections/categories

**Aanlysis Performed**:

* Set up the Library Management System Database: Create and populate the database with tables for branches, employees, members, 
  books, issued status, and return status.
* CRUD Operations: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
* CTAS (Create Table As Select): Utilize CTAS to create new tables based on query results.
* Advanced SQL Queries: Develop complex queries to analyze and retrieve specific data.
* Used JOIN to combine multiple tables and extract meaningful insights.

**Reports**

1) Database Schema: Detailed table structures and relationships.
2) Data Analysis: Insights into book categories, employee salaries, member registration trends, and issued books.
3) Summary Reports: Aggregated data on high-demand books and employee performance.
